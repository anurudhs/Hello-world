Customer Pain Points and Expectations from Font Management Solution

Font Management Software
1.As of now customers need to access their fonts from several places.
	- Multiple Web sites, Skyfonts, Toolkit and FEX Server (Distrubution framework provided by the organisation)
2.Customers need some fonts from subscription and some fonts from their own collection.
	- Provide an ease to organisation their fonts on structures like Font Usgae, Classification, etc.
3.Customers often need to share collection of fonts (subscription+own) internally/externally.
	- Proof copy or sample copy needs to be shared for approval with the maximumn options available.
